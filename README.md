# Customtkniter Countdown App

I created a countdown timer with customtkniter which was suggested by a Discord friend called blazethecatman.

Features:
Python code.
An hourglass.gif as a progress bar animation
An alarm sound to indicate when the timer is over.
Light/Dark toggle mode.
Usage of Customtkniter to make a more modern UI

Issues:
There is a pause/resume button that I haven't figured out yet
